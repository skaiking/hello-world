hello-world
===========
Hello.  My name is sky. I am an amatuer mathematician and physicist, and I am interested in learning about R coding, data science, statistics, and programming to find novel ways of doing things.  Long term I hope to learn a lot and post on this website often.  Hopefully I'll figure out how to write a popular app that people will like, or I will be able to do something worthwile with this.  I am considering using what I learn to work on finding the asteroids in the current NASA coding project. 

Anyways, thanks to any who read my codes and offer help!
